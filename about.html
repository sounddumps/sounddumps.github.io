        <h2>Hey there!</h2>
        <p>I'm Alex, a student from Europe. I am interested in technology and that's why I created this website. It's mostly an attempt to learn HTML, CSS and more, but it's also fun to work on. I have tried to keep this it as lightweight as possible, while also making it functional, easy on the eyes and privacy-respecting. Currently, it has no 3rd party trackers and is hosted on GitHub pages. I get most of my older Windows ISOs from <a href="https://winworldpc.com/library">WinWorldPC</a>. <a href="https://paypal.me/sounddumps">Feel free to donate</a> if you want to support this project, and thanks for visiting. I hope you find this website helpful!
